# OpenHV Server ![Size](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/openhv/server)

[OpenHV](https://github.com/OpenHV/OpenHV) Docker container based on [Microsoft .NET image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) makes it easier to deploy OpenHV dedicated servers on Linux with graphics and sound files stripped away.

## Usage

```
docker run -it -p 1234:1234 ghcr.io/openhv/server:latest "Server.Name=My Server"
```

## Build

Run

```
docker build -t openhv:latest .
```

to compile and

```
docker run -it -p 1234:1234 openhv:latest .
```

to start an instance with TCP 1234 as the default port.

```
docker run -it -p 4711:4711 openhv:latest "Server.Name=Docker Test Server" "Server.ListenPort=4711"
```

to change server name and TCP network port.
